# COMPRISE - Voice Transformation

This repository gives access to the tools that have been used, implemented and/or delivered to transform the voice, as part of the COMPRISE project :

- The first one (v1) is a python library that implements 2 voice conversion methods, both using VLTN. Documentation and installation instructions are in the [README](./v1/README.md).

- The second one (v2) implements an anonymization method using x-vectors and neural waveform models. This method has been used as the baseline of the Voice Privacy Challenge 2020. Documentation and installation instructions are in the [README](./v2/README.md).

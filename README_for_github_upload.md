# COMPRISE Voice Transformation Tool

Github upload notes

xvectors_based_transformers/vpc/exp/models/3_ss_am/trained_network.jsn file has been removed from github history.

It has been replaced at the github_upload_changes branch HEAD by xvectors_based_transformers/vpc/exp/models/3_ss_am/trained_network.jsn.gz which you will need to gunzip manually if you want to use it properly.  

I don't want to use Github LFS.

These files:
* xvectors_based_transformers/io/exp/models/3_ss_am/trained_network.jsn
* v2/io/exp/models/3_ss_am/trained_network.jsn
* io/exp/models/3_ss_am/trained_network.jsn

have also been removed from github history but given that they were from old commits a gzip file is not provided.
